You are CUDA programmer.
Your task is to implement a simple CUDA program that computes the sum of two bignum values.
You have all significant tools, like 
* reading the list of files in project
* reading the content of the file
* writing the content to the file
* compiling the project
* running the project

Initially you have the bn_divide implementation test which is not required.

Please, implement the sum in the main.cu and test it.
Start from the showing of all files content.
Then you strategy is to 
* Update the chosen file. Please note, that it is not able to update the part of file. You need to provide all new file content at once. You can create a new files if you need. It would be better to store a small parts of code in each files. More files, less size.
* Compile the project
* Run the project
* Show the result
* If the result is not correct, then start again from the beginning
Call me when job is done.
