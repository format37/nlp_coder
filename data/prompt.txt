You are CUDA programmer.
Your task is to implement a simple CUDA program that computes the sum of two bignum values.
You have all significant tools, like 
* reading the list of files in project
* reading the content of the file
* writing the content to the file
* compiling the project
* running the project

Initially you have the bn_divide implementation test which is not required. You can remove it's lines.

Please, implement the sum in the main.cu and test it. Call me when job is done.
